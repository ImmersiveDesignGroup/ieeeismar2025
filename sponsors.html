<h3>Sponsoring ISMAR</h3>
<p>You are invited to support the ISMAR 2025 conference. This is an ideal way to demonstrate your organization’s interest in and commitment to the 
    field of mixed and augmented reality, and to publicize this support to many leaders and students in the field. Corporate support is used to permit 
    a greater number of students to attend ISMAR at reduced fees without artificially increasing the general registration, to support our diversity 
    initiatives such as the Women’s Lunch and travel grants, and to allow student volunteers to receive complimentary registration. Corporate support can 
    also enable recruitment at the conference during coffee breaks and the demo session, and during this year’s optional sponsor campus tour. ISMAR has 
    historically been sponsored by some of the largest firms in the technology sphere, enabling our community to grow and flourish.</p>

<p>This year, since many of our sponsors have campuses located in the conference city, we will be creating a map of these campuses for ISMAR attendees to 
    visit on Thursday during the day, guided by student volunteers. We see this as an opportunity for sponsors to show off demos and spaces that would not 
    be possible in the confines of the demo session, and of course for recruitment. As sponsors indicate interest, we will finalize the logistics and timing 
    of this activity.</p>

<p>The ISMAR 2025 conference has four corporate support levels: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Your support is critical to the conference, and the 
    conference committee works to design appropriate thank-you gestures. We list the benefits and costs of the support levels below; sponsors are under 
    no obligation to take all benefits.</p>
